## Developer Guidelines:

[Link to Chatbot API documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots)


A sample MS Teams chatbot app is included in `reference_demos/bot-sso/`, to test this app locally to get a feel for how chatbots work:
- Install the Teams Toolkit in VS Code
- Open the `reference_demos/bot-sso/` folder in VS Code
- Press `F5` to locally build the app in debug mode; it should ask you to authenticate with your Microsoft account and open an instance of the locally running Hello World app in a browser instance of MS Teams
